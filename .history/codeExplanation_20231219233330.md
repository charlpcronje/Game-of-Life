## Detailed Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries

```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
```

- **`numpy`**: This library is used for numerical operations. Here, it's primarily used to handle arrays which represent the game grid.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: A plotting library used for creating visualizations. In this script, it's used to display the state of the game.
- **`matplotlib.animation`**: A submodule of matplotlib used for creating animations. This is key to visualizing the dynamic evolution of the game grid over time.

### Defining the Update Function

```py
def update(frameNum, img, grid, N):
 ...
```

- The `update` function is called for each frame of the animation. It updates the game grid based on the rules of the Game of Life.
- **Parameters**:
 - `frameNum`: The current frame number of the animation.
 - `img`: The matplotlib image object that is used to display the game grid.
 - `grid`: The current state of the game grid.
 - `N`: The size of the game grid (NxN cells).

Within this function:

- **Creating a Copy of the Grid**: `newGrid = grid.copy()`
 - It's important to work on a copy of the grid so that all updates are based on the same initial state for each frame.
- **Iterating Over Each Cell**: Nested loops iterate over each cell in the grid.
- **Calculating the Number of Alive Neighbors**:
 - The script sums the states of the eight neighboring cells (using modulo `%N` for wrapping around the edges).
- **Applying the Game Rules**: Based on the number of alive neighbors, the script updates the state of each cell:
 - A live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies (underpopulation or overpopulation).
 - A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
- **Updating the Image Data**: `img.set_data(newGrid)`.
 - The matplotlib image object is updated with the new grid state.

### Setting Initial Constants

```py
ON = 255  # alive cells
OFF = 0   # dead cells
N = 100   # grid size
```

- `ON` and `OFF` represent the states of a cell (alive or dead). Here, `255` (white) represents an alive cell, and `0` (black) represents a dead cell in the visualization.
- `N` sets the size of the grid to 100x100 cells.

### Initializing the Grid

```py
grid = np.random.choice([ON, OFF], N*N, p=[0.2, 0.8]).reshape(N, N)
```

- This line creates an NxN grid with each cell randomly assigned to be either ON (alive) or OFF (dead).
- The probability of a cell starting in the ON state is 20% (`p=[0.2, 0.8]`).

### Setting Up the Plot

```py
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
img = ax.imshow(grid, interpolation='nearest')
```

- A matplotlib figure and axes are created.
- `imshow` displays the initial grid as an image, with the `nearest` interpolation method.

### Creating the Animation

```py
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
img = ax.imshow(grid, interpolation='nearest')
```

- `FuncAnimation` creates the animation. It calls the `update` function for each frame.
- `fargs` provides additional arguments to the `update` function.
- `frames` is the number of frames to generate. In this case, it's set to 10.
- `interval` is the delay between frames in milliseconds.
- `save_count` indicates how many frames to keep around for saving the animation.

### Displaying the Animation

```py
plt.show()
```

- Finally, `plt.show()` is called to display the window containing the animation.

### Summary

This script simulates Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, in a 100x100 grid. It visualizes the evolution of the grid using an animation, where each frame represents a step in the simulation according to the game's rules. The initial state of the grid is randomized, and the game progresses without any further input, showcasing complex patterns that emerge from simple rules.
