## Explanation of the Code

- **Grid Initialization**: The create_grid function creates an NxN grid, where each cell is randomly set to either ON (alive) or OFF (dead).

- **Printing the Grid**: The print_grid function prints the current state of the grid to the console, with spaces between cells for readability.

- **Counting Neighbors**: The count_neighbors function calculates the number of alive neighbors for a given cell.

- **Calculating the Next Generation**: The next_generation function applies the rules of Conway's Game of Life to produce the next state of the grid.

- **Running the Game**: The run_game function initializes the grid and then continuously updates and displays the grid, creating an ongoing simulation.

- **Clearing the Console**: The script uses `os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')` to clear the console screen between each generation, giving the appearance of animation.


## Usage
Run this script in a Python environment. It will display the evolving Game of Life in your console. You can stop the game by interrupting the execution (usually Ctrl+C in the console).

This implementation is a basic console-based version and will not have the smooth animation or visual appeal of a graphical version, but it does demonstrate the core logic of Conway's Game of Life.
